## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

An API is a license in a way or ticket to interact with a given website/s and or software.  I have yes, interacted with an API as an end user.  This was with a website called cheapflights and also I'm assuming weather widgets utilize these.  I have also once researched API's in order to understand how they could work, where one could create a food delivery app that would send invoices to customers and merchants receipts via a whatsapp API(which was not available at the time).

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

Interface - is what you interact with and use to visually create or make a website perform an action.
API - is what you use to call, push for information and or perform an instruction according to the rules of that API's owners.


3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

Types of API learned:
- Rest API
- Browser API
- Web API
- GraphQL API

  What I found the most interesting are Rest Api's because these are in widely used.  They are in my opinion more open for developers, esspecially if you are reletively new in the field.  

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

Yes, I believe I have come accross and used an API.  I believe, if I am not mistaken that it was a web API.  In Scrimba we had to create a mobile application that allowed us to connect to the database.  Which allowed us to put data into the database, remove and change it.

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

I believe I could link an API to my script but however when it comes to the area I need to improve, that that would definitely need to be my understanding of JavaSript in order to write code that would allow my application to perform the set task.

 steps 
- to improve by practicing more JavaScript
- improve my overall full stack web application abilities and not struggle with CSS anymore
- more tutorials in building applications and incorporate more in simple apps I build
- read up more on the subject
